# code_test

Plowing through "Cracking the Coding Interview" questions.

For each chapter, I've tried:
1. Initial solve - got most of them wrong or got stuck during the process
2. Practice - solved the same question the next day. If stuck, the questions are highlighted
3. Only highlights - focus on the highlighted questions from #2
